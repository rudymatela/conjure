-- Some notes:
--
-- From GHC 7.8 to GHC 7.10,
-- null, foldr and other functions were generalized
-- from lists to foldable containers.
-- The type application for the old version of null
-- is different than the one for the new version.
--
-- In the case of this file this is not really an issue
-- as the above change was introduced before TypeApplications even existed.
--
-- This illustrates that
-- we may have to use a different type application patterns
-- when using different versions of libraries.
-- In some cases, code using TypeApplications may be
-- less portable than it's full type binding counterparts.
